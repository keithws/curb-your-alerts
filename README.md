# Curb Your Alerts

Prevent JavaScript dialog boxes from popping up on websites.

## Why

Because, JavaScript dialog boxes are not usually used by modern websites. However, JavaScript dialog boxes are used by malicious websites and web developers who don't know about `console.log` nor `debugger`.

## Install

Download the Curb Your Alerts Safari extension and open the file to install.

Of course, you can always clone this repository and build the extension from source too.
